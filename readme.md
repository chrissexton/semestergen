# Semestergen

This is a relatively nerdy niche that even I have little use for any longer. The purpose is to configure courses as single TOML files that can be used to coordinate date calculations and simplify site generation for a course syllabus.

In practice, this is used as a GitHub Action that automatically rebuilds a repository containing a course's content. Unfortunately, I cannot currently publish an example course.
